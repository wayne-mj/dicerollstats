### Statistics simulations

These are some simple simulations of statistical concepts using Python.  An expansion on the Memory/Concentration game I wrote for my son.


### Dice roll games

Some simple dice roll games written in Python.

#### High/Low

The dice is rolled a number of times and the tally of high (4,5,6) and low (1,2,3) rolls are calculated and ratio of high to low is displayed.

#### Odd/Even

Similar to High/Low but the tally is of odd and even rolls.

#### Prime

Tests if the roll is a prime number.

#### Square/Square root

Tests if the roll is a square number or a square root of a number.

#### Use of padding

Each script has a padding feature ```pad``` which is also used to set the ```max_iter``` value to ```1 * 10**(pad-1)```.

This just helps to make the output look a bit neater.
